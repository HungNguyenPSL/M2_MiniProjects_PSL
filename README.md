# Mini Projects Repository

This repository contains the implementation of mini projects completed during my Master 2 in Mathematics, Machine Learning, Sciences, and Humanities (MASH) at [PSL University](https://psl.eu/en). For more information about the program, visit the [MASH Master's Program](https://dauphine.psl.eu/en/training/masters-degrees/mathematics-and-applied-mathematics/masters-year-2-mathematics-deep-learning-and-humanities).

These mini projects are implemented and designed to run directly through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), allowing for easy execution and sharing.
